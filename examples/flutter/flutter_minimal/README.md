# Shen.AI SDK Flutter minimal example

This is a minimal Flutter example for Shen.AI SDK.

To run the example, you'll need to download the Flutter SDK from the Developer Portal and place it in this directory as `shenai-sdk` (referenced locally in `pubspec.yaml`).

You'll also need an API key that can be generated on the Developer Portal. You can place the API key [here](./lib/main.dart#L7) to run the example.
