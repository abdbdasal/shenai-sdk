# Shen.AI SDK React Native minimal example

This is a minimal React Native example for Shen.AI SDK.

To run the example, you'll need to download the React Native SDK from the Developer Portal and place it in this directory as `react-native-shenai-sdk` (referenced locally in `package.json`).

You'll also need an API key that can be generated on the Developer Portal. You can place the API key [here](./App.tsx#L22) to run the example.
