# Shen.AI SDK Javascript minimal web example

This is a minimal JS web example for Shen.AI SDK.

## How to run the app

1. Download the web SDK from the Developer Portal and extract it in this directory as `shenai-sdk`.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite text editor.
3. Set your API key in [`API_KEY`](./index.html#L10). You can access your API keys in the Developer Portal.
4. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
5. Start the example using `yarn start`. Open the output URL (probably `http://localhost:3000`) in a browser (Google Chrome preferably).

## Using the app

When the app is running you should see the measurement window and camera stream. Messages on the screen should give you instructions how to take your first measurement.
