# Shen.AI SDK

This repository contains integration examples of Shen.AI SDK for all supported platforms.

Please see readme files in the relevant example directory for quickstart instructions and customization notes.

_Note: These examples are for version 2 (beta) of the SDK. Please see the [v1](https://github.com/mxlaboratories/shenai-sdk/tree/v1) branch for examples of the previous version._

## Developer Portal

For more information and SDK documentation please visit the Shen.AI Developer Portal. Documentation for version 2 of the SDK is being prepared at:

- [docs-beta.shen.ai](https://docs-beta.shen.ai)

You'll need to download the SDK from the Developer Portal and place it in the relevant example directory in order to run the example. You'll also need an API key that can be generated on the Developer Portal.

> To see documentation for v1 of the SDK, go to [developer.shen.ai](https://developer.shen.ai)

## Supported platforms

Shen.AI SDK currently supports the following platforms:

- [Flutter](./examples/flutter/) (both iOS and Android)
- [Android](./examples/android/)
- [iOS](./examples/ios/)
- [Web](./examples/web/)

Code examples and apps can be found under `examples` in subdirectories corresponding to the platforms.

## SDK Playground

To easily see what methods are available in the SDK, you can use the **SDK Web Playground**. You can either build it yourself from the [playground](./playground) directory or use the hosted version at [playground.shen.ai](https://playground.shen.ai). You'll need an active Web API key in either case.
